# YasminHackeruFinal
A full‑stack web project portfolio by Yasmin – built while studying at HackerU.

## 📝 Project Overview
This repository contains both the backend and frontend parts of my portfolio/web‑application project created during my full‑stack web development course at HackerU.
The goal is to demonstrate skills in frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress) and backend (SQL, server‑client database project, C#) development.

## 🚀 Structure
- **`frontend/`** — Contains the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc).
- **`backend/`** — Contains the backend code and database integration.
- **`.gitignore`** — Files/folders ignored by Git.

## ✅ Features
- Responsive web layout.
- Interactive UI elements via JavaScript.
- Database‑backed backend (C# + SQL) to manage data.
- Integration between frontend and backend demonstrating full‑stack capability.
- Clean, modular code structure suitable for portfolio presentation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- WordPress (for CMS portion or site variants)
- C# (.NET) for server‑side logic
- SQL (database queries & data management)
- Git / GitHub for version control

## 🎓 What I Learned
- How to build a complete web application end‑to‑end: from frontend UI to backend logic and database.
- How to integrate different technologies (WordPress if used) and manage frontend-backend communications.
- Best practices in code structure, modularity, and separation of concerns.
- Using Git & GitHub to maintain version history and work collaboratively (even solo).

## 📂 Getting Started
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yasmin300/YasminHackeruFinal.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd YasminHackeruFinal
   ```
3. For the backend:
   - Open the `backend/` folder in Visual Studio (or your IDE of choice).
   - Restore dependencies, build the project.
   - Configure the database connection (update `appsettings.json` or equivalent) and ensure the SQL database is accessible.
   - Run the backend server.
4. For the frontend:
   - Open the `frontend/` folder.
   - If it’s a static site, open `index.html` in your browser; if it uses a development server (like `npm`, etc), follow the setup instructions.
   - Ensure that frontend calls to backend endpoints are configured (e.g., URL, ports).

## 🧪 Testing
- Manual testing of UI responsiveness, links, form submissions.
- Backend API endpoints tested via Postman or browser.
- Database queries verified for correct behavior and data handling.
